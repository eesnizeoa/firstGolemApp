## Simple Golem App Feature Show

### Description
This application was made with RStudio making use of the data visualisation aid called Shiny.
Golem is a package that can help get you organised. You can build modules like components in vue.js.
That means that you can use them multiple times and organise modules in modules based on their interactions.
They can also help seperate css and js files.

This particular application is just a simple use of golem package and shiny system. I used the famous iris dataset to show different features.
For the lasts parts, you can choose the columns you want to display, it works with the table display and the plot display. 
This use can be transfered to any dataset.
In the code, import a dataset and repace the name "iris" in this code.
